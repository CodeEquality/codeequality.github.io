      <h3>What is CodeEquality?</h3>
      <p>
        CodeEquality is a non-profit organization that aims to promote computer science awareness among young Malaysians, with the hope that those who gain early exposure to programming would go on to pursue a career in the tech industry.
      </p>

      <h3>How did we start?</h3>
      <p>
        Long story short: it was difficult talking to organizations and schools as two random people who want to offer programming courses. It made sense to build an organization to represent our objectives. So here we are.
      </p>

      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>We're currently a team of two co-founders.</p>
      <p> <strong>Wunmin Wong</strong>
        Wunmin graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Management Science with minors in Energy and Economics. She is currently a Product Manager at JobStreet Malaysia and has experience working as an Associate at the Boston Consulting Group. Her biggest regret is not majoring in Computer Science in university, hence she is passionate in promoting early awareness of Computer Science among young Malaysians.
      </p>

      <p> <strong>Sher Minn Chong</strong>
        Sher Minn is a B.S. Computer Science and Philosophy graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. By day, she works at IBM Malaysia as a consultant and by night, she is a freelance web developer and designer. Mostly self-taught in design and web, she developed an interest in teaching as a student instructor for the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wes-cs/">WES-CS program</a>
        at her alma mater. She's always excited about teaching programming, front-end web development and graphic design. Talk to her on
