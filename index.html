        <h3>What is CodeEquality?</h3>
        <p>CodeEquality is a non-profit organization that aims to promote computer science awareness among young Malaysians, with the hope that those who gain early exposure to programming would go on to pursue a career in the tech industry.</p>

        <h3>How did we start?</h3>
        <p>Long story short: it was difficult talking to organizations and schools as two random people who want to offer programming courses. It made sense to build an organization to represent our objectives. So here we are.</p>
        
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>CodeEquality is currently a team of two co-founders.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Wunmin Wong</strong> Wunmin graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Management Science with minors in Energy and Economics. She is currently a Product Manager at JobStreet Malaysia and has experience working as an Associate at the Boston Consulting Group. Her biggest regret is not majoring in Computer Science in university, hence she is passionate in promoting early awareness of Computer Science among young Malaysians.
