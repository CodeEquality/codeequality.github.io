<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>An introductory hands-on course for those who want to learn how to build websites with HTML and CSS. </p>

<p><strong>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every website</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong> is used to describe the content of a site. For example, this very paragraph is described in HTML. </p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong> is used to style websites. All of the color and fonts, <span style="color:#f25405; font-weight:bold; font-family:Arvo, serif">like this sentence</span> that you see on this site is described in CSS. </p>

<p>Together, they can be used to build functional and beautiful websites. If you’ve ever wondered how websites were made and how you can make your own, now is the time to learn!</p>
