<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every website. HTML is to create the content of a site. For example, this very paragraph is written in HTML. CSS is used to style websites. All colors and fonts, <span style="color:#f25405; font-weight:bold; font-family:Arvo, serif">like this</span> on websites are written in CSS. Together, they can be used to build functional and beautiful websites.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://railsgirls-my.github.io/app/">Rails Girls KL tutorial</a> also uses HTML and CSS. If you want to learn how to style your web application differently and make it prettier, this is the class for you!</p>

<p>** Do apply even if you didn’t attend the previous Rails Girls Ruby on Rails workshop! You won’t be any disadvantage as this is for beginners with no coding experience.</p>
