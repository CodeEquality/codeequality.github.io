##What is this?
{{page.excerpt}} 

__HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every website__. 

__HTML__ is used to describe the content of a site. For example, this very paragraph is described in HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

__CSS__ is used to style websites. All of the color and fonts (<span style="color:#f25405; font-weight:bold; font-family:Arvo, serif">like this sentence!</span>) that you see on this site is described in CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
