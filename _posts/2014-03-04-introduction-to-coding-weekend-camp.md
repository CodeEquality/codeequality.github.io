##What is this?
This is a weekend introduction to coding course tailored for students who are interested in coding but have yet to venture into it. We'll be doing sessions on general coding concepts, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, a high-level programming language ideal for beginners, and HTML/CSS as an introduction to programming and web development.

Sessions will be led by Wun Min and Sher Minn of Code Equality. You can find out more about us in our <a href="http://codeequality.org/index.html#about">About section</a>.

##When and where is this happening?

Yes! If you're interested in learning how to code, this is for you! We welcome everyone from all walks of life, but do note that this session is designed for students of ages 16 and above who have no previous coding experience as we will be starting from the very basics.
