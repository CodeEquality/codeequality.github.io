##What is this?
This is a weekend introduction to coding course tailored for students who are interested in coding but have yet to venture into it. We'll be doing sessions on general coding concepts, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, a high-level programming language ideal for beginners, and HTML/CSS as an introduction to programming and web development.

Sessions will be led by Wun Min and Sher Minn of Code Equality. You can find out more about us in our <a href="http://codeequality.org/index.html#about">About section</a>.

##When and where is this happening?
March 29th-30th (Saturday & Sunday) at Wisma Jobstreet in Kuala Lumpur. This camp will run from 9am to 5pm on both days, with hour-long lunch breaks.

Please note that this is a 2-day event and we will require your commitment and attendance for both days.


##Is this for me?
Yes! If you're interested in learning how to code, this is for you! We welcome everyone from all walks of life, but do note that this session is designed for students of ages 13 and above who have no previous coding experience as we will be starting from the very basics. You will need to __bring your own laptop__ for the weekend and be able to __stay for both days of the camp and for 9am-5pm each day__.

We are limiting this session to 30 people only, but we will have a waiting list, so don't hesitate to put your name in!
