##What is this?
This is a weekend introduction to coding course tailored for students who are interested in coding but have yet to venture into it. We'll be doing sessions on general coding concepts, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, a high-level programming language ideal for beginners, and HTML/CSS as an introduction to programming and web development.

Sessions will be led by Wun Min and Sher Minn of Code Equality. You can find out more about us in our <a href="http://codeequality.org/index.html#about">About section</a>.
