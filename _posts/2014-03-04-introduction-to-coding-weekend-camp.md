##What is this?
This is a weekend introduction to coding course tailored for students who are interested in coding but have yet to venture into it. We'll be doing sessions on general coding concepts, Python, and HTML/CSS to give you a bit of experience with programming and web development.

Sessions will be led by Wun Min and Sher Minn of Code Equality. You can find out more about us in our <a href="http://codeequality.org/index.html#about">About section</a>.

##When and where is this happening?
March 29th-30th (Saturday & Sunday) at Wisma Jobstreet in Kuala Lumpur. This camp will run from 9am to 5pm on both days, with hour-long lunch breaks.

Please note that this is a 2-day event and we will require your commitment and attendance for both days.


##Is this for me?
Yes! If you're interested in learning how to code, this is for you! We welcome everyone from all walks of life, but do note that this session is designed for students who have no coding experience as we will be beginning from the very basics of programming.

We are limiting this session to 30 people only, but we will have waiting lists, so don't hesitate to put your name in! 

##How much does this event cost?
It's free! However, we do require a RM20 fee for registration, which will be refunded once you have completed the course.

##How do I sign up?
Just fill out this online form (<strong>soon to come, please check back next week</strong>) and we will email you with a confirmation of your seat in this course! We will notify you and put you on the waiting list if all seats have been taken.
