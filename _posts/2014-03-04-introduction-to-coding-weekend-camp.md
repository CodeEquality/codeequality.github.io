##What is this?
This is a weekend introduction to coding course tailored for students who are interested in coding but have yet to venture into it. We'll be doing sessions on general coding concepts, Python, and HTML/CSS to give you a little taste of each.

##When and where is this happening?
March 29th-30th (Saturday & Sunday) at Wisma Jobstreet in Kuala Lumpur.


##Is this for me?
Yes! If you're interested in learning how to code, this is for you! We welcome everyone from all walks of life, but do note that this session is targeted to students who have no coding experience as we will be beginning from ground zero of programming.

We are limiting this session to 30 people only, but we will have waiting lists, so don't hesitate to put your name in! 

We do ask for a RM20 registration fee. At the end of the class, you may decide to have it refunded to you, or not.

##How do I sign up?
Just fill out this online form here and we will email you with a confirmation of your seat in this course! We will notify you and put you on the waiting list if all seats have been taken.

##I got a seat! What now?
