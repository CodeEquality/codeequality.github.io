##The Visit
This is the first in the Code Equality series of company visits, and we are kicking off with the local Google Malaysia office! 

We only have 25 seats available, so sign up as soon as possible to grab a spot! 

##Who is this for?
This visit is open to all! However, we would like to give priority to secondary school and pre-university students. This is an event for those who are curious about what it's like working in a major tech company and its career opportunities. We hope that it will aspire those who have yet to decide on a major or career path to further explore opportunities in tech.
