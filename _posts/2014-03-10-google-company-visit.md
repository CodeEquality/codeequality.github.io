##The Visit
This is the first in the Code Equality series of company visits, and we are kicking off with the local Google Malaysia office! 

##Who is this for?
This visit is open to all! However, we would like to give priority to secondary school and pre-university students. This is an event for those who are curious about what it's like working in a major tech company and its career opportunities. We hope that it will aspire those who have yet to decide on a major or career path to further explore opportunities in tech.
