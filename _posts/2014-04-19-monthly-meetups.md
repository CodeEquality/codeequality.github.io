##What is this?
We’re starting a regular meetup for beginner coders who want to learn how to code on their own. We will be using guided materials from [Code.org](http://code.org) and [Udacity](http://udacity.com) which students can complete at their own pace. 

We’ll have helpful tutors around to help you out too!

__Bring your own laptop and laptop charger!__

No sign-ups are necessary. Please be there by 10am as we will have to let you in.

##What are we learning this session?
We will be going through [CS 101: Intro to Computer Science from Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)
where you will learn to build a search engine and a social network.


##Who is this for?
This is perfect for people with no or little coding experience!

We are open to everyone of all age groups and skill levels, although the materials we will be using are designed for beginners. 

##Why should I come for this?
You can learn to code on your own at home. What we hope to provide with our meetups is a __community of people excited about learning how to code__. If you complete a course with us, you get to be on our __Hall of Fame for New Coders (coming soon)__! Not to mention the fact that we have __helpful tutors to lend you a hand__ when you get really stuck!

In a nutshell, you get to:

* __Meet other people who are interested in coding and tech__
* __Get featured on our Hall of Fame of New Coders__
* __Helpful tutors to guide you when you get stuck__
* __Get motivated to learn coding regularly__

##I can’t make it! When is the next one?
We are planning to make this a regular event, however we’re just trying things out with this pilot event. Follow us on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/codeequality) for our next meetup!


##I wanna be a volunteer tutor!
