##What is this?
HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every website. HTML is to create the content of a site. For example, this very paragraph is written in HTML. CSS is used to style websites. All colors and fonts, <span style="color:#f25405; font-weight:bold; font-family:Arvo, serif">like this</span> on websites are written in CSS. Together, they can be used to build functional and beautiful websites.

The [Rails Girls KL tutorial](http://railsgirls-my.github.io/app/) also uses HTML and CSS. If you want to learn how to style your web application differently and make it prettier, this is the class for you!

** Do apply even if you didn't attend the previous Rails Girls Ruby on Rails workshop!

If you are selected for the class, we will email you with a invitation email. You need to complete the form to confirm your seat.

<div class="well">
Note: If you have received an invitation and confirmed your attendance but cannot attend, please let us know at before October 8, 11:59PM so that we can provide the seat to another student.
</div>

Please be on time. Plan to arrive at least 15 mins before the event to allow time to find the venue. For security reasons, we will have to tag you into the building. As such, we cannot allow entry for latecomers.

##I have no coding experience, is this for me?
Yes! Suitable for beginners and ideal for secondary school students and above. We do ask that participants be at least 13 years old to join this class. 

If you are a parent and would like to sign up for a younger child, please get in touch with us to ensure that the pace of the class would be suitable for them.

##Can I still join this class if I did not attend the previous [Rails Girls KL workshop](http://railsgirls.com/kl)?
Absolutely! You won't be at any disadvantage as we will not be using Ruby on Rails during the workshop.

##Will we be learning Ruby or Rails here?
Nope, though we'll be doing a quick demo of how you can change the html/css in your Rails Girls KL web application.

##Is this free?
Yes! But we are not providing any food/coffee. 

##I'm a guy, can I attend?
Men are welcomed. However, priority for seats will be given to ladies.

##What will we be doing?
We will be building a static website from scratch! By the end of the class you will have the basics to further venture out in the world of web design and development. Here is an example of a <a href="http://mcopages.com/sherminn/" target="_blank">simple homepage</a>. Some of the topics we'll be covering are the basics of HTML/CSS, website design and how to upload a website.

##What do I need to bring?
Yourself, a __laptop__, __charger__ and enthusiasm to learn. 

Any type of laptop or operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc) can be used for this class. Please make your own arrangements to borrow a laptop for this class if you do not own one.

###Before the class
* Install a browser. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) are preferable.
* Install a text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
